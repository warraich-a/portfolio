					</header>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Take ideas from one place and apply it on other place.</li>
							<li>Refashion already created ideas</li>
							<li>Original does not mean creating something new, use whats around us. And created
								a new combination.
							</li>
							<li>You do not always need to find gold in jeweler shops, it can be found from rivers. 
								For example, there are many creative minds in prisons.
							</li>
							<li>Part of new learning is that you have to be confused. You can have everyone think 
								you are weird.
							</li>
							<li>Push boundaries: <sup>Creativity is getting out of your comfort zone to try and think Different.</sup>

					<h2 style="background-color:#e44530;">Everyday creative thoughts</h2>
					<p>If you want to learn to be creative then one of the best ways is to set two alarms everyday, and think about two questions:
						<ul>
							<li>1. Where did you use your creative thoughts?</li>
							<li>2. Where you could called upon your creative thoughts?</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

						<h3>Thoughts/Ideas</h3>
						<p>This is a summary of my two weeks creative thoughts.</p>
					</header>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li> 
								<h1>Day 1</h1> 
								<h4>Noon</h4>
									1. Letterbox scanner: In this current situation letterbox should have sanitizers, e.g. when you have a new post
									that will be scanned with sanitizers.
									<br>
									2. Cleaning the snow from from the cars, i.e. there could be an easier way to clean the snow from the cars. 
									<br> <br>
								<h4>Evening</h4>
									1. Raspberry pi can be connected to laptop through a hdmi port, instead of buying a new monitor.
									<br>
									2. Connecting Raspberry pi with laptop, i.g. it is possible.
							</li>
							<li> 
								<h1>Day 2</h1> 
								<h4>Noon</h4>
									1. WhatsApp can have groups in hiding, for example a specify group of people 
									from whom you can hide or show status. Because it's terrible to select every time specific audience, so you can better have groups. 
									<br>
									2 .Melting the snow. 
									<br> <br>
								<h4>Evening</h4>
									1. A book can have some kind of information, like the last page where you left.
									<br>
									2. Roads cleaning, for example how can this automatically be done.
							</li>
							<li> 
								<h1>Day 3</h1> 
								<h4>Noon</h4>
									1. Fork that measures the temperature and also check how clean the food is.
									<br>
									2. Working with raspberry pi, exploring it more.
									<br><br>
								<h4>Evening</h4>
									1. Corona virus detecting glasses.
									2. Better way to use navigation system, instead of looking at one side for the navigator. 
							</li>
							<li> 
								<h1>Day 4</h1> 
								<h4>Noon</h4>
									1. Erik concept for designing the logo can be used to create vikings famous quotes logo.
									<br>
									2. Use the python code from erik github, that could be used by myself. And add something myself in it.
									<br><br>
								<h4>Evening</h4>
									1.Beard Trimming reminder app or machine can be created. e.g. it can give you a reminder in case you forget to trim  your beard.
									<br>
									2.

			<article id="Log_book" class="container box style1">
				<header>
					<h2 style="background-color:#80ff00;">Log Book</h2>
					<p>If you want to learn to be creative then one of the ways is to set create a log book in which you write about the interactions with the technology on daily basis.
						It can be done in several ways, e.g. set alarm every half hour to get a reminder to write the log book.
					</p>
					<p>Below I have written my two days log book.</p>
				</header>
				<section>
					<h3>Day 1</h3>
					<ul class="log_book_list">
						<li> 
							17:00	😁      Watched cricket on mobile.
							<br>I am happy because I watched cricket on my mobile instead of TV
							<br>
						</li>
						<li>17:30	😁		Checked Dagcard
							<br> I looked for a train dagcard online instead of going to any train station and ask anyone in person. This indeed saved alot of my time.
						</li>
						<li>
							18:00	😁		Contacted Friend
							<br> I wanted to talk to my friend, which I did through my mobile phone. If there was no phone, I would need to go to him which would of course take a lot of time
						</li>
						<li>
							18:30	😁		Notes written
							<br> To take the notes, I used the notepad instead of writing them on an actual notebook. 
						</li>
						<li>
							10: 05	😫		Ordered food online
							<br> To eat I just ordered online through an app, however I could save me some money by cooking myself.

						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Day 2</h3>
					<ul class="log_book_list">
						<li> 
							17:00	😁		Used LEDs in raspberry pi
							<br>
						 	I am happy because I learned to use LEDs through breadboard and raspberry pi 4
						</li>
						<li>18:00	😁		PIR motion sensor used
							<br>	I am happy because I used motion detector in my practice.	
						</li>
						<li>
							19:00	😁		Raspberry Pi camera module
						<br>		I am happy because I learned how to use camera with motion detector PIR.	</li>
						<li>
							20:00	😁		Updated raspberry pi
						<br>		To update raspberry pi, i simply used my Windows terminal instead of starting it through vnc.	</li>
						<li>
							21: 00	😫		Asked google to set an alarm
							<br> 	To set an alarm I asked google by speaking, however I could create an alarm myself. I am sad in a sense, technology making me more lazy.

						</li>
					</ul>
					<h1>5 years comparison</h1>
				<p>In this section I tried to compare the interactions mentioned above with 5 years ago and 5 years in the future. To get the correct answer I asked myself 3 questions
					as:
					<ol id="Comparison_questions" class="Comparison_questions">
						<li>Remember 5 years ago, which technology did not exist or didn’t you use back then?</li>
						 <p>
							Most of the technologies with I had the interactions were available also 5 years ago. But if look back how I used to set alarms 5 years ago, then I 
							can clearly notice that I used to do it manually. However, now I simply ask google assistance to set an alarm for me. Other than that if I think about 
							how we used to make food orders, then I remember that I either used to call the restaurant or go myself to get the food and plus it was hard to choose from menu that way. 
							But now I simply visit the website or apps like thuisbezorgd and I can choose from plenty of restaurants and make an order in just few minutes. Now is definitely much easier. 
							<br>
							If I talk about raspberry pi then there were several things that were not so popular back then, for example Object Detection. But now it is very common in especially in smart cameras.
							However, it does not has big impact in my life but it is playing an important role in security systems to detect people, face detection for unlocking the phones and more.
						</p> 
						<li>Does this say something about the quality of life then?</li>
							In my point of view, Now the quality of life is somewhere in the middle in a sense that, we are relying on these technologies even 
							for small reasons such as ordering the food. However, we can go to get the food. On the other hand, quality of life is improved at most place such as 
							security has improved by using the technologies. 
						<li>What about the future? What will be normal in 5 years which we don’t have know?</li>
						<p>
							Technology has been improving a lot, especially from last two decades and so on. In this crucial time, IOT plays an important role in Healthcare system.
							Therefore, I believe in next 5 years there will be some kind of a disease prediction devices.

					<h2 style="background-color:#80ff00;">Erik Driessen's Ideas</h2>

				</header>

				<div class="row">
					<p>Erik Driessen is a creative man who inspired me with his ideas. What inspired me was that you can use creativity anywhere. One of his ideas is to generate 
						visualization by analyse music lyrics (text) for sentiment using Google Natural Language API. Which he printed on T-shirts. 
						<a href="http://www.edriessen.com/avicii/" target="_link">Here</a>
						 is the link to his idea.
					</p>
				  <div class="col-6">
					<p>To experiment his idea I also decided to visiualize one of my favorite albums <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Saw-Me-Coming-Faydee/dp/B08957JJMK" target="_link">(Never Saw Me Coming)</a>
						of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/faydee/?hl=en" target="_link">Faydee</a>. One of the several visualizations result is this:</p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="col">
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/path-straight-clean.png" /></a>
				  </div>
				  <div class="col-6">
					  <p>And after some designing I created the logo on the right side. </p>
					
				  </div>
				  <div class="col">
					 <a class="image fit"><img src="images/Avicii_my_final.jpg" /></a>

				  </div>
				  <div class="col-6">
					  And then Erik's idea was to put this logo on a t-shirt. And I also did the same thing, which can be seen on the right side. 
				  </div>
				  <div class="col">
					 <a class="image fit"><img src="images/Final-shirt.png" /></a>

							<h2 style="background-color:#80ff00;">What is vision?</h2>
							<p>Vision is the ability to close your eyes and visualize a future that still does not exist. It is the desire to look past the chaos that might be before you, to abstract from it, to clean it up, and to see a future that does not yet exist (hopefully better). </p>
							
							<h2>My Vision in Semester 4</h2>
							<p>On the left you can see what is my vision. However, I will explain it further. 
								There are three main points that I want to focus on learning this semester <br>
								<b>Commitment:</b>  <br>
								I want to focus on commitments, for example I want to learn to achieve my targets by making commitments to myself. <br>
								<b>Confidence:</b>  <br>
								In this semester I want to learn to be more confident on my hard work. <br>
								<b>Ambition:</b>  <br>
								I want to be ambitious in this semester, because we have a chance to decide our ideas. That is why, I want to use my ambitions there.
								That is why they are on top of my head. 
								
							</p>
							<p> Plus I want to have a grip on 2 things this semester, <b>Raspberry pi with Python</b> and <b>Exercising</b>. That is the reason in my vision they are drawn on the hands</p>
							<p>
								At the same time, I want to smile having good motivation, however I want to get out of my comfort zone.

				<header>
					<h2 style="background-color:#80ff00;">What is my idea</h2>

				</header>
				<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12">
					<p>In this crucial time. We all want to be safe therefore, my first Idea was to create a AR-glasses which can detect the distance between you and the 
						person around you and inform you to keep some distance.<b> But</b> then I realized along with my teacher Geert Jan that this idea was not making much sense that is why we came up with another idea. 
					   </p>
						<h3>New Idea</h3>
						<b>COVID-vaccinators detecting by face</b> <br>
						Basically, the idea is that you can see through your glasses if anyone is COVID-vaccinated or not. Although, in this project pictures will be stored
						locally to compare faces but it can be extended to use the database and APIs.
						<br>  <br>

						<h3>Programming Language</h3>
							To achieve this target Python programming was used along with opencv.
						
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					   <h2 id="Prototype_goal">Prototype Goal</h2>
					   <p> To begin with prototype I first had to decide where I want to attach the camera. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
					<h3>Idea 1</h3>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Sketch-1.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>One idea was to attach the camera on one of the sides of the glasses</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
					<h3>Idea 2</h3>
					<a class=""><img src="images/Sketch-2.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Another idea was to attach the camera in the middle of the glasses</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
				<p>I preferred the idea of attaching the camera in the middle, this way camera can have more for detections, however to correctly approach this idea
					I followed the idea of David Neumann from Humber College Canada. The idea was pretty simple, all I needed was one straw, contact cement, novelty glasses 
					and a clothes pin. 
					And then connect the camera connected to glasses. </p>
