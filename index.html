					</header>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Take ideas from one place and apply it on other place.</li>
							<li>Refashion already created ideas</li>
							<li>Original does not mean creating something new, use whats around us. And created
								a new combination.
							</li>
							<li>You do not always need to find gold in jeweler shops, it can be found from rivers. 
								For example, there are many creative minds in prisons.
							</li>
							<li>Part of new learning is that you have to be confused. You can have everyone think 
								you are weird.
							</li>
							<li>Push boundaries: <sup>Creativity is getting out of your comfort zone to try and think Different.</sup>

					<h1 style=" background-color: #e44530;">Everyday creative thoughts</h1>
					<p>If you want to learn to be creative then one of the best ways is to set two alarms everyday, and think about two questions:
						<ul>
							<li>1. Where did you use your creative thoughts?</li>
							<li>2. Where you could called upon your creative thoughts?</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Thoughts/Ideas</h3>
						<p>This is a summary of my 4 day's creative thoughts.</p>
					</header>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li> 
								<h2>Day 1</h2> 
								<h4>Noon</h4>
									1. Letterbox scanner: In this current situation letterbox should have sanitizers, for example when you have a new post
									that will be scanned with sanitizers.
									<br>
									2. Cleaning the snow from from the cars, i.e. there could be an easier way to clean the snow from the cars. 
									<br> <br>
								<h4>Evening</h4>
									1. Raspberry pi can be connected to laptop through a hdmi port, instead of buying a new monitor.
									<br>
									2. Connecting Raspberry pi with laptop, i.e. it is possible.
							</li>
							<li> 
								<h2>Day 2</h2> 
								<h4>Noon</h4>
									1. WhatsApp can have groups in hiding, for example a specify group of people 
									from whom you can hide or show status. Because it's terrible to select every time specific audience, so you can better have groups. 
									<br>
									2 .Melting the snow. 
									<br> <br>
								<h4>Evening</h4>
									1. A book can have some kind of information, like the last page where you left.
									<br>
									2. Roads cleaning, for example how can this automatically be done.
							</li>
							<li> 
								<h2>Day 3</h2> 
								<h4>Noon</h4>
									1. Fork that measures the temperature and also check how clean the food is.
									<br>
									2. Working with raspberry pi, exploring it more.
									<br><br>
								<h4>Evening</h4>
									1. Corona virus detecting glasses.
									2. Better way to use navigation system, instead of looking at one side for the navigator. 
							</li>
							<li> 
								<h2>Day 4</h2> 
								<h4>Noon</h4>
									1. Erik concept for designing the logo can be used to create vikings famous quotes logo.
									<br>
									2. Use the python code from erik github, that could be used by myself. And add something myself in it.
									<br><br>
								<h4>Evening</h4>
									1.Beard Trimming reminder app or machine can be created. e.g. it can give you a reminder in case you forget to trim  your beard.
									<br>

			<article id="Log_book" class="container box style1">
				<header>
					<h1 style="background-color:#80ff00;">Log Book</h1>
					<p>If you want to learn to be creative then one of the ways is to set create a log book in which you write about the interactions 
						with the technology on daily basis.
						It can be done in several ways, such as set alarm every half hour to get a reminder to update the log book.
					</p>
					<p>Below I have written my two days log book.</p>
				</header>
				<section>
					<h3>Day 1</h3>
					<ul class="log_book_list">
						<li> 
							17:00	😁      Watched cricket on mobile.
							<br>I am happy because I watched cricket on my mobile instead of on TV
							<br>
						</li>
						<li>17:30	😁		Checked Dagcard
							<br> I looked for a train day car online instead of going to any train station and ask anyone in person. This indeed saved a lot of my time.
						</li>
						<li>
							18:00	😁		Contacted Friend
							<br> I wanted to talk to my friend, which I did through my mobile phone. If there was no phone, I would need to go to him which would of course take a lot of time
						</li>
						<li>
							18:30	😁		Notes written
							<br> To take the notes, I used the notepad instead of writing them on an actual notebook. 
						</li>
						<li>
							10: 05	😫		Ordered food online
							<br> To eat I just ordered online through an app, however I could save me some money by cooking myself.

						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Day 2</h3>
					<ul class="log_book_list">
						<li> 
							17:00	😁		Used LEDs in raspberry pi
							<br>
						 	I am happy because I learned to use LEDs through breadboard and raspberry pi 4
						</li>
						<li>18:00	😁		PIR motion sensor used
							<br>	I am happy because I used motion detector in my practice.	
						</li>
						<li>
							19:00	😁		Raspberry Pi camera module
						<br>		I am happy because I learned how to use camera with motion detector PIR.	</li>
						<li>
							20:00	😁		Updated raspberry pi
						<br>		To update raspberry pi, i simply used my Windows terminal instead of starting it through vnc.	</li>
						<li>
							21: 00	😫		Asked google to set an alarm
							<br> 	To set an alarm I asked google by speaking, however I could create an alarm myself. I am sad in a sense, technology making me more lazy.

						</li>
					</ul>
					<h1 style="background-color:#80ff00;">5 years comparison</h1>
				<p>In this section I tried to compare the interactions mentioned above with 5 years ago and 5 years in the future. To get the correct answer I asked myself 3 questions
					as:
					<ol id="Comparison_questions" class="Comparison_questions">
						<li>Remember 5 years ago, which technology did not exist or didn’t you use back then?</li>
						 <p>
							Most of the technologies with I had the interactions were available also 5 years ago. But if look back how I used to set alarms 5 years ago, then I 
							can clearly notice that I used to do it manually. However, now I simply ask google assistance to set an alarm for me. Other than that if I think about 
							how we used to make food orders, then I remember that either I used to call the restaurant or go to the restaurant myself to get the food and plus it was hard to choose from menu that way. 
							But now I simply visit the website or apps like thuisbezorgd and I can choose from plenty of restaurants and make an order in just few minutes. Now is definitely much easier. 
							<br>
							If I talk about raspberry pi then there were several things that were not so popular back then, for example Object Detection. But now it is very common, especially in smart cameras.
							However, it does not have a big impact in my life but it is playing an important role in security systems for instance human detection, face detection, face recognition, and more.
						</p> 
						<li>Does this say something about the quality of life then?</li>
							In my point of view, now the quality of life is somewhere in the middle in a sense that, we are relying on these technologies even 
							for small reasons such as ordering the food. However, we can go to get the food. On the other hand, quality of life is improved at most place such as 
							security systems are improved with these technologies. 
						<li>What about the future? What will be normal in 5 years which we don’t have know?</li>
						<p>
							Technology has been improving a lot, especially from the last 3 to 4 decades. In this crucial time, IOT plays an important role in Healthcare system.
							Therefore, I believe in next 5 years there will be some kind of a disease prediction devices.

				<header>
					<h1 style="background-color:#80ff00;">Erik Driessen's Ideas</h1>

				</header>

				<div class="row">
					<p>Erik Driessen was our guest lecturer and he is a creative man who inspired me with his ideas. What inspired me the most was that you can find creativity anywhere. One of his ideas is to generate 
						visualization by analyzing music lyrics (text) for sentiment using Google Natural Language API. Which he printed on T-shirts. 
						<a href="http://www.edriessen.com/avicii/" target="_link">Here</a>
						 is the link to his idea.
					</p>
				  <div class="col-6">
					<p>To experiment his idea I also decided to visualize one of my favorite albums <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Saw-Me-Coming-Faydee/dp/B08957JJMK" target="_link">(Never Saw Me Coming)</a>
						of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/faydee/?hl=en" target="_link">Faydee</a>. One of the several visualizations results is this:</p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="col">
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/path-straight-clean.png" /></a>

				  <div class="col">
					 <a class="image fit"><img src="images/Avicii_my_final.jpg" /></a>

				  </div>

					  And then Erik's idea was to put this logo on a t-shirt. And I also did the same thing, which can also be seen on the right side.

						<header>
							<h4>What is vision?</h4>
							<p>Vision is the ability to close your eyes and visualize a future that still does not exist. It is the desire to look past the chaos that might be before you, to abstract from it, to clean it up, and to see a future that does not yet exist (hopefully better). </p>
							
							<h4>My Vision in Semester 4</h4>
							<p>On the left you can see what is my vision. However, I will explain it further. First of all there is a leadership icon standing behind. That is one of the main things I want to focus in this semester. 
								however along with leadership there are three main points that I want to focus on learning this semester <br>
								<b>Commitment:</b>  <br>
								I want to focus on commitments, for example I want to learn to achieve my targets by making commitments to myself. <br>
								<b>Confidence:</b>  <br>
								In this semester I want to learn to be more confident on my hard work. <br>
								<b>Ambition:</b>  <br>
								I want to be ambitious in this semester, because we have a chance to decide our ideas.
								That is why they are on top of the head.  <br>
							 Plus I want to have a grip on 2 things this semester, <b>Raspberry pi with Python</b> and <b>Exercising</b>. That is the reason in my vision they are drawn on the hands</p>
							<p>
								At the same time, I want to smile having good motivation, however I want to get out of my comfort zone.

				<header>
					<h1 style="background-color:#80ff00;">What is my idea</h1>

				</header>
				<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12">
					<p>In this crucial time. We all want to be safe therefore, my first Idea was to create a AR-glasses which can detect the distance between you and the 
						person around you and inform you to keep some distance.<b> But</b> then I realized along with my teacher Geert Jan that this idea was not making much sense that is why we came up with another idea. 
					   </p>
						<h3>New Idea</h3>
						<b>COVID-vaccinators detecting by face</b> <br>
						Basically, the idea is that you can see through your glasses if anyone is COVID-vaccinated or not. Although, in this project pictures will be stored
						locally to compare faces but it can be extended to use the database and APIs.
					</div>
					<div id="Implementation" class="col-12">

				
						<h3>Implementation</h3>
						<h6>Programming Language</h6>
							<p>
							   To achieve my target first of all I had to realize what programming language I should choose. There were different options such as Matlab, Python, Java and C/C++/C#. 
							   Although I had experience with Java, C++ and C# but I have always been very curious to learn to Python. And Python is indeed one of the most popular languages for such 
							   projects. Therefore, I decided to choose Python, however to learn the basics of Python that I took a short course (10 hours long) On Udemy. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Now when I was done with the course, I wanted to begin with my project. But then I realized that object detection or face recognition was not possible alone in Python.
								I had to learn other libraries such as Dlib, OpenCV to perform such tasks. 
							</p>
							<p>
								That is when I started learning OpenCV, I followed a short course on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs&list=LL&ab_channel=Murtaza%27sWorkshop-RoboticsandAI">YouTube</a>  
								of one of the  <a href="#">instructors</a> that I was following during the project.
							</p>
							<p>
								I used Face_recognition library for face recognitions along with cv2 to compare with the existing faces. 
								In case you are interested in code, here is the <a href="https://github.com/warraich-a/s4-COVID-19-Vaccination-Detector">link</a>  to the project on Github.
							</p>
						</div>
			
				<div class="col-12">
					   <h1 style="background-color:#80ff00;" id="Prototype_goal">Prototype Goal</h1>
					   <p> In the beginning I was wondering more about creating 
						   an end product, but then we got a workshop on Prototype which made me realize that
						   Lo-Fi prototype does not have to be an end product. It is just one idea for user testing. Of course, it gave me some relief. And
						   to begin with prototype I first had to decide where I want to attach the camera.
					   </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
					<h3>Idea 1</h3>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Sketch-1.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>One idea was to attach the camera on one of the sides of the glasses</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
					<h3>Idea 2</h3>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Sketch-2.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Another idea was to attach the camera in the middle of the glasses</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
				<p>I preferred the idea of attaching the camera in the middle, this way camera can have more for detections, however to correctly approach this idea
					I followed the idea of David Neumann from Humber College Canada. The idea was pretty simple, all I needed was one straw, contact cement, novelty glasses 
					and a clothes pin. 
					And then connect the camera to glasses. </p>
					
					<h3>Example</h3>
					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Lo-Fi.png" alt="" /></a>

				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<h1 style="background-color:#80ff00;">Prototype Setup</h1>
					<p>To start with actual prototype, first of all I need to have a smaller camera which could be attached with the glasses. The camera I had was night vision
						camera, which was of course not a suitable option for my project. Then one day I just realized the it is possible to remove the infrared LEDs from both sides
						of the camera. Therefore I simply removed the parts I did not need for my project. </p>
					</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<h4>Camera with Infrared LEDs</h4>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Camera.jpeg" /></a>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<h4>Camera without Infrared LEDs</h4>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Camera2.jpeg" /></a>
						</div>
			
					<div class="col-12">
						<h4>Prototype Version 1.0</h4>
						<p>Below you can see how I attached the camera in the middle of the glasses</p>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Final1.jpeg" /></a>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Indvidual-Prototype-final.jpg" /></a>
					</div>
					<div id="Result" class="col-12">
						<h3>Result</h3>
						And here is video of working results. <br>
						 *hints: Green rectangle over the face means, the person is COVID-vaccinated, and red rectangle means not.
						<video width="100%" height="600" controls>
							<source src="images/Video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
							Your browser does not support the video tag.
						  </video>
					</div>
					<div id="Recomendation" class="col-12">
						<h3>Recommendations</h3>
						Since Raspberry pi can only process 0.9 FPS, and I have used Dlib with HOG model, 
						that is why the performance is not very fast. Therefore, I have few recommendations written below:
						<br> <br>
							<ul>
								
								<li>Hardware</li>
								<h6>NVIDIA GPUs</h6>
								You can consider NVIDIA GPUs as hardware instead of Raspberry Pi.
								<li>Software</li>
								<h6>OpenCV or Dlib</h6>
								If you are willing to deep dive into better performance and you have time for that, I would for sure recommend
								face-detection with OpenCV - DNN method as it is pretty fast and very accurate, 
								even for small sized faces. It also detects faces at various angles. 
								<br>

								However, if you do not want to go very deep in the topic, then I would recommend Dlib - HOG as it is one of the fastest methods on CPU. 
								but it does not detect small sized photos or from different angles. 
								
								<br>
								<br>
							 	<b>	If you want to have a best performance, you should try YOLOv3 with NVIDIA GPUs. That will give you an extremely better and accurate performance. </b>

						An interactive art installation will capture a person's facial expression (raspberry pi) and translate this into a design made with creative coding.
						 The user would get to experience and interact with their emotion and have a positive experience with it.

								<h1 style="background-color:#80ff00;">Design Process</h1>
								To achieve our targets we followed ICDP (Idea + Concept + Design + Product) process, which is originally created by our teachers. 
								<br><br><a class="image fit"><img src="images/Design-Process.png" alt="" /></a> <br>
								However, to follow it correctly we divided the complete process into small parts as in the picture above.

								<h5>Dream</h5>
								The project started of with discussion on different topics for example, <b> personal interests, vision, and (tech) potentials</b>
								of both of us. However coming up with the idea went quite well because we both wanted to make something for people to spread happiness.
						
								
								Our <b>limitations</b> was time, we only had 4-5 weeks to finish this project. 
								On the other hand, the <b>user need</b> was to create something that allow people to interact with their 
								emotions. And to find the <b>clear problem</b> we imagined how difficult is nowadays for people to find happiness in public places.

							<div class="col-12 float-left"> 
								<h3>Explore</h3>
								Now when we had an idea, we started to look for an <b>inspiration</b>. 
								We were inspired by many projects such as: <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/72383155/SK-II-Future-X-Pop-Up-Store?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cinteractive%20art%20installation" target="_blank"> SKII Future X, </a>
								<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/91186295/Arkhe?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Ccreative%20coding" target="_blank">ARKHE</a>. 
								However, to improve our idea we <b>brainstormed</b>, and we came up with another idea: 
								"Every time you interact with a camera, 
								it captures an expression and in the end of the day it gives an animation 
								or a graph which shows if you were happy, sad, or angry. And then it can maybe motivate you.". But then we realized that this idea works only for one person. Therefore, we decided to stick our original idea. 
								<br> <br>
								To realize the <b>impact</b> of this idea, we asked 3 questions to ourselves. <br> <br>
								<b>1. What’s the change in your idea? </b>  <br> 

								We want people to feel like they can be open about their emotions by visualizing them and giving people the possibility to interact with it. 
								Besides that we want people to feel connected to each other on a deeper level by experiencing emotions together.  
								<br> <br>
							 	<b>What’s the story behind your idea? </b>	<br>

								People don’t openly talk about their true emotions enough because often there is some kind of shame or fear about it. 
								People tend to feel like everything needs to be okay which causes them to act like everything is fine when it’s not. 
								The goal is to make people feel more comfortable and less shame or fear about it and just feel more open and positive. Also it’s important to remind people that they’re not the only ones feeling a certain way. 
								Being able to visually see other people’s emotions could comfort a person and connect with them on a deeper level.  
								<br> <br>
								<b>Do you see possibilities for a tribe? </b>  <br>

								There would be possibilities for a tribe because we want to create something where people can interact with emotions 
								but it is also something a larger group of people can experience together. 
								This also makes it easier to be open and share your emotions and this can create a special and much deeper connection 
								with people around you since you don’t have to say it out loud. 
								<br> <br> 
								To implement the idea first of all we had to do the <b>user research</b> to realize how users would like to experience it, which was actually very helpful and we
								created 2 different <b>sketches</b> from the research which can be seen below: <br> <br> 
								
								<div class="col-6 float-left">
									<b>Sketch 1</b>
									<br> One of the idea we got through research was to see the visuals on a big screen. <br>
									<br><a class="image fit"><img src="images/User-Research-Sketch-1.png" alt="" /></a> 
								</div>
								
								<div class="col-6 float-right">
									<b>Sketch 2</b>
									<br> Second idea we got was, to have double sided screen and person on the other side of the screen can see your emotions in visuals. 
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/User-Research-Sketch-2.png" alt="" /></a> 
								</div>
							
								<br> We got very positive response from people, they were excited to interact with their emotions. Other than that, 
								we realized that our project is for almost everyone to experience, but to include even more people we could add sound. 
								<b>so deaf people can also experience.</b>
							<!-- </div>


							<div class="col-6 float-right">  -->
							<h3> Experiment</h3>
								To explore our idea we did <b>tech research</b> and experimented different ways, and then decided the most efficient and suitable approach for our project. <br>
								<br> After research we found three different ways to detect emotions and draw visuals: 
								<ul class="li"> <b> 1. Emotion detection in Processing itself using some online APIs or libraries</b> <br>
									This option do a lot of work behind the camera. And it is not flexible for example it does not provide emotion score.</ul>
								<ul class="li"> <b> 2. Do the Emotion detection in python and connect it with Processing through WebSockets.</b> <br>
									Emotion detection in Python is easy and it is more flexible and it provides emotion detection score, plus we can choose which emotions to show.</ul>
								<ul class="li"><b> 3. Create the visuals using some Python Animation libraries and get rid of Processing. </b><br>
									There are few Python libraries which can be used for creating the animations such as Matplotlib, but they do the basic animation such as live graph etc.</ul>
									<br>
								
								After research and some basic experiments we decided to use the <b>option 2.</b> Because emotion detection on Python is not just easy to understand but also provides
								more details and options.
								<br><br>
								<b>Proof of Concept</b><br>
								To prove our concept we use the technique that we learned in one of the workshops that we got on <b>Design For Humanity</b>. <br> <br>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Design-for-humanity.png" alt="" /></a>  <br>
								and we figured out that we want to use openness to create connections. We want people to show their feelings. We could use a good question 
								such as <b> "Do you dare to show your true colours?"</b> or <b> " Do you dare to show your true animal?"</b>. It's good to have it in a public space 
								where people aren't forced to do it but by doing it in public, we can dare them to interact with it and show the real them. 
								This encourages them to put themselves in a vulnerable position but also makes them see that it’s okay to experience the emotions you do. 
								It could be on a big screen but could also be a two-sided screen, so you see another person’s emotion and they look at yours to help with 
								getting the deeper connection.

								<h3> Know </h3>

								Now it was time to deep dive into Specification and design. One of the first steps was to describe <b>Use Scenario</b> for example:
								<ul>1. John Doe stands in front of the camera. </ul>
								<ul>2. System detects the face and emotions of John. </ul>
								<ul>3. System displays visuals according to the detected emotions</ul>
								<ul>4. John Doe changes the emotions on his face.</ul>
								<ul>5. System detects the face and emotions of John Doe and Displays visuals.</ul> 

								However, to make the <b>interaction design</b> a bit real we made <b>early prototypes</b> and asked feedback from different people, which can seen
								below:
								<br>
								 <div class="col-8">
									<h4>Colors of Emotions</h4>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/colors-for-emotions.jpg" alt="" /></a> 

								 </div>
								 <br><br>
								<div class="col-6 float-left">
									<h4>Single side screen</h4>
								   <a class="image fit"><img src="images/early-prototype-1.jpg" alt="" /></a> 
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 float-right">
									<br> <br>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/result-single-side-screen.jpg" alt="" /></a>  <br>  
								</div>
								
								<div class="col-6 float-left">
									<br><br>
									<h4>Double side screen</h4>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/early-prototype-2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									
								</div>

								<div class="col-6 float-right">
									<br> <br><br>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/result-double-side-screen.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								</div>

								
								<div class="col-12 float-left"> 
									More people like the idea of single side screen. They said that it is a better way to experience the emotions of the other person and makes a connection.
									That is why we decided to have a single screen.
								<!-- </div>
								<div class="col-12"> -->
									<h4>Interaction Design</h4>
									Here you can see the interaction design idea. Multiple single screen can be placed side by side and that way people behind and the user himself can see the visuals.
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Visual-interactive-design.png" alt="" /></a>

								<h3>Iterate</h3>
								<h4>Hardware & Software Research</h4> We started of with software research since in hardware we only needed a camera along with 
								a computer such as (Raspberry Pi, Laptop) etc. In software research first thing we had to do was to find a way to detect the emotions. Since we already decided 
								to use Python for that. We found 2 libraries that could do this task: 1. OpenCV. 2. TensorFlow. <br>
								<br>
								 <b>Why OpenCV?</b> <br>
								OpenCV is one of the most important libraries in such tasks, it allows to capture each frame in the video so that further tasks such as emotion detection, facial 
								recognition etc can be done. 
								<br> <br>
								<h5>For example, method to capture each frame</h5>
								 
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/cv2-captureMethod.png" alt="" /></a>  <br>
								<b>Why TensorFlow?</b> <br>
								TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. And it allows many possibilities in simple ways, such as emotion detection. 
								<br> <br>
								<h5>For example, method to detect emotions</h5>
								 
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/TensorFlow-method.png" alt="" /></a>  <br>
							<br>
								Now when emotion detection was working in Python, we had to send detected emotion to Java so that visuals could be made. For that we did different <b>Tech Experiments</b>,
								such as options were as follows: <br> <br>
								<h5>Server(Python), Client(Java)</h5>
								<div class="server-python" style=" text-indent: 50px;">
									<h6>Advantages</h6>
									<li>Fast: whenever there was an emotion detection it was send to the client side.</li>
									<li>Java Side will only be focussed on visuals, which makes the visuals fast</li>
									<h6>Disadvantage</h6>
									<li>Wait for the client connection</li>
								</div>
								
								<br> 
								<h5>Server(Java), Client(Python)</h5>

								<div class="server-java" style=" text-indent: 50px;">
									<h6>Advantages</h6>
									<li>Does not have to wait for client connection</li>
									<h6>Disadvantage</h6>
									<li>Always receive the emotion detection</li>
									<li>Visuals will be slow, because of multiple tasks in one application such as server processing and visuals</li>
									
								</div>
								
								That is why we decided to go for the first option. However, sockets are used to build a constant connection between two applications.
								Now we was able to send the detected face location along with emotion score to Java through sockets connection. <br>
								Below you can see a short video of the results. <br>
									*hint: The left side with camera is Python side with emotion detection and the right side with moving white rectangle is Java side in Processing. 
								<div class="col-12">
									<video width="100%" height="600" controls>
										<source src="images/FirstVersion.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										Your browser does not support the video tag.
									  </video>
								</div>
								
								Now when were able to send the face location and emotion recognition to Java, it was time to start working on Visuals. Further explanation is provided in next sections. 
								To give you have a better idea of how the process worked, here is the <b>Activity Diagram</b> for one of the emotions <br>

								<h3>Build & Integrate</h3>
								To start building the visuals, we brainstormed on each emotion to come up with the <b>ideas</b> of the visuals. For that we used <a href="https://padlet.com/rachellevdkar/yyonc3c45771edfh" target="_blank" >this Padlet</a>.
								We started creating the visuals for each emotion. But at one point we realized people might not like to have all the emotions. Therefore we asked <b>feedback</b>
								from few people. Most people did not want to have fear or disgust in their visuals, that is why we decided to not have those 2 visuals. Now we had 5 emotions, neutral,
								happy, sad, angry, surprise. <br> <br>
								Now when we decided to work on the remaining 5 visuals, the process of <b>Decomposition</b> begun. We started experimenting each visual separately in simple sketches. For example:
								In a separate sketch the visuals for only sad was created, same approach applied to all the visuals. 
								<br><br>
								It was time to <b>integrate</b> the visuals to our project. That went pretty smooth for us.
								Because we had the code for all the visuals ready in smaller projects. 
								The <b>Evaluation</b> of the visuals can be seen below.
								<br>
								<div class="col-12"></div>
									
									<div class="col-6 float-left">
										<ul>Happy = Flower that shines like sun and it will not just follow the face but also the size and intensity will increase and decrease 
											with emotion score.
										</ul> 
										<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Happy-visuals.png" alt="" /></a>  <br>

									</div>
									<div class="col-6 float-right">
										<ul>Angry = Bright red hard visuals, they will not just follow the face but also the size and intensity will increase and decrease 
											with emotion score. </ul>
										<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Angry-visuals.png" alt="" /></a>  <br>

									</div>
									<div class="col-6 float-left">
									<ul>Sad = Normal Rain, but more rain that follows your face and emotion score for example if you are more sad then more rain 
										will be seen on your face location.
									</ul>
										<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Sad.png" alt="" /></a>  <br>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 float-right">
									<ul>Surprise = Fireworks that follows follows your face</ul>

								<h5>Test</h5>
								Before presentation it is always good to have some tests, that is why we did <b> <a href="https://github.com/warraich-a/Duo-Project/blob/main/Documentation/Testing/Testplan%20.doc" target="_blank">functional testing</a> </b> in which we created use cases for each 
								scenario and test cases along with test plan. 
								<h5>Present</h5>
								Due to COVID-19 we have limitations in presentation, therefore we will only present in our University in front of our teachers and students.

							<h3 >Individual Project </h3>
								Since this semester is demand based and this project was an Individual Project, therefore I had a freehand in coming up with an idea and developing myself 
								in various places other than just programming.
								I developed my vision, which gave me a clear way to follow during the semester. The most important thing that I learned in this project 
								was how to think creatively, for example Daily Dose Of Creative Thoughts, 5 Years Technology Comparison. Now I do not worry about being wrong, I realized no idea is wrong, it is just being different.
							<h3 id="duoProject">Duo Project</h3>
								In this project I learned how to grow gradually by following different techniques such as having a Design Process ready.
								 I am definitely going to use this approach for my future projects. I used to exaggerate simple problems by overthinking the technical sides in the very beginning of the project. In this project I learned 
								 how <b>not</b> to think directly regarding programming because there are several tasks that should be done before programming such as inspiration, brainstorme, user research and most importantly tech research. 
								 This way I had my concept clear in the start which definitely helped me in the tasks that come later, for example software and hardware research.
